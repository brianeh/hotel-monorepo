# Docker Compose Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed
# Note: .env files are automatically loaded by docker-compose

# Paths to service directories on the host filesystem
# When running from Mac host: leave unset (uses relative paths ./hotel-monolith and ./hotel-api-rest)
#   The relative paths work because docker-compose resolves them from the docker-compose.yml location
# When running from devcontainer: set to absolute Mac host paths
#
# To find your Mac host path from within a devcontainer:
#   1. The workspace path in VS Code devcontainers is typically mounted at /workspaces/hotel-monorepo
#   2. Check VS Code workspace settings or the actual mount path
#   3. Or run: docker inspect <devcontainer-name> | grep -A 10 Mounts
#   4. Then use that Mac host path for the base path below
#
# Defaults: ./hotel-monolith and ./hotel-api-rest (relative paths from docker-compose.yml location)

# Base path for the monorepo (only needed when running from devcontainer)
# Uncomment and set to your Mac host path:
MONOREPO_BASE=/Users/bhooper/workspace/brianeh-repos/hotel-monorepo

# Individual service paths (only needed when running from devcontainer)
# These use the MONOREPO_BASE variable above for convenience
HOTEL_MONOLITH_PATH=${MONOREPO_BASE}/hotel-monolith
HOTEL_API_REST_PATH=${MONOREPO_BASE}/hotel-api-rest
HOTEL_UI_REACT_PATH=${MONOREPO_BASE}/hotel-ui-react

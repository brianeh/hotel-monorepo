# Path to hotel-monolith directory on the host filesystem
# When running from Mac host: leave unset or use relative path (default: ./hotel-monolith)
#   The relative path works because docker-compose resolves it from the docker-compose.yml location
# When running from devcontainer: set to absolute Mac host path
#   Example: MONOREPO_HOST_PATH=/Users/username/path/to/hotel-modernization/hotel-monolith
#
# To find your Mac host path from within a devcontainer:
#   1. The workspace path in VS Code devcontainers is typically mounted at /workspaces/hotel-modernization
#   2. Check VS Code workspace settings or the actual mount path
#   3. Or run: docker inspect <devcontainer-name> | grep -A 10 Mounts
#   4. Then use that Mac host path for MONOREPO_HOST_PATH
#
# Default: ./hotel-monolith (relative path from docker-compose.yml location)
MONOREPO_HOST_PATH=./hotel-monolith
